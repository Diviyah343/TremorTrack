# TremorTrack

TremorTrack is a web-based motor screening tool designed to observe and visualize hand movement patterns commonly associated with Parkinson’s disease.  
It provides simple, non-invasive interaction tests to support early awareness and symptom monitoring.

##  Overview

Parkinson’s disease often begins with subtle motor changes such as hand tremors, reduced control, or slowed movement.  
TremorTrack offers a lightweight, software-only approach to help users understand these motor patterns through guided tests and automatic analysis.

This project is intended for **screening, monitoring, and educational purposes only**.
